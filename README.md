This project is organized at the end of my second semester in my first year at university. I worked full stack of the project website and the backend for the windows form application. Me and the other three teammates were working together to help a virtual startup company called **Media Bazaar** establish its reputation in the city of Eindhoven. More details is included in the Project Description in the documents folder!

## General info
At present, the newly founded Media Bazaar company for consumer electronics is trying to establish its reputation in the city of Eindhoven. As a consequence of their short presence in the market they lack the financial resources that are needed to get themselves up and running. Therefore, the funds are provided by their parent company Jupiter which will ensure that they thrive in the competitive environment of electronics retailers. In order to achieve this goal the company wants to take advantage of the digital revolution and have their own internal management system. Consequently, they have started a competition for software companies to come up with a design and as a reward the company will give them a contract for the job. 

Our company LogiK will strive to make a reliable, robust and user-friendly software for Media Bazaar in order to stand out from the crowd. Our goal is to develop a full-fledged application for the administration and an online employee dashboard for the employees. In addition, currently the company utilizes online calendars and excel sheets to manage all their resources which is quite laborious and time-consuming. Therefore, an automated and stable system is required to keep up with the ever-increasing pace of business. Also, it provides us with the opportunity to develop everything from scratch while following the highest standards.
